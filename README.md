# designing_relational_database

## Introduction
My first project for creating a relational database for my research during my doctorial studies was a very difficult experience. Sometime after the successful completeion of my studies, I was faced with a task to design and create an RDB for a client. Going through my notes and reading around to find a simplar approach to perform the task, I chance on a tutoria by Craig Dickson, one of my favoriate data science gurus. 

Combining my notes with that of Craig's tutorial was a game changer for me. In this notebook, I present the amalgamated approach to creating an RDB using Craig's data. I intend to present a similar project I did using data pulled from Kaggle shortle.
